# About The Project

Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather updates, a 5-day temperature forecast, and air quality index (AQI) data, supporting both city-based and live location-based weather searches.

Built a smart alert system that recommends whether it’s suitable to go for outdoor activities like hiking, walking, or dining out, based on weather conditions such as rain, wind, and AQI levels.

Added clothing material suggestions tailored to the current weather and AQI, helping users stay comfortable and make informed health-conscious choices. The app also evaluates air quality and informs users whether it’s safe or unhealthy to be outdoors, based on AQI thresholds
